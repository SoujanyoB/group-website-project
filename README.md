# group-website-project

This is a personal project. Started creation on 29/04/2020. Currently private project.
Trying to make a project to make collaborations of the group on activities or decisions we make, maybe while buying something,
or adding checklists.

If I ever make this public, by that time this readme will be fun to read I suppose, lol.

1. Sync the project in VSCode
2. Open cmd in the folder
3. Run npm init
4. Run npm install
5. P.S. Connect to the internet first, duh!
6. After install type, npm install nodemon -g , and enter
7. Done? Now type, nodemon server.js , and press enter
8. P.S Make sure you're in the are group-website-project folder and server.js is visible

To do ->
1) Add codeforces handles of users who log in and rank all the handles according to their ratings
2) Display the last five successful submissions of all the users
3) Create a gallery to display pictures uploaded by users
4) Add youtube playlists of songs from the users youtube profiles.
5) Create a chat iterface 
6) Link database lol

Done ->

Nothing so far lol
